I apologize for the weird formatting of the files. I'm not sure if it's the models or the examples, but github was having troubles uploading my local branch, so I had to upload the files manually.
Please move the models (the files with the .keras extensions) into a folder called "models", or run the python scripts that create the models.

All scripts can be run with the following command:

python [fileName].py
